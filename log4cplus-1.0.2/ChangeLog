  - Fixed compilation warning in MSVC for pointer.h


Version 0.9.10 (August 27 2003)
  - Fixed singled-threaded build compilation issues
  - The DailyRollingFileAppender no longer truncates files
  - The DailyRollingFileAppender now performs a "rollover" on close().  If the 
    "rollover file" exists, then it will be renamed according to the pattern 
    that is used by the RollingFileAppender class.  (Thanks Philip Green for
    the suggestion.)
  - Some socket-unix.cxx corrections.
  - Fixed the *Factory initialization so that it compile with the HP aCC
    compiler.
  - Corrected the getCurrentThreadName() for MacOS X and DEC.

Version 0.9.9 (August 9 2003)
  - Fixed many MSVC++ compilation errors (6 and 7).
  - Updated the MSVC++ projects
  - Modified the Time::getFormattedTime() method to increase performance
  - Modified Hierarcy::getInstanceImpl() to "deep copy" Logger names.
  - Corrected some of the PatternLayout documentation to work better with
    doxygen.
  - Some Borland C++ Builder 6 fixes.


Version 0.9.8 (August 3 2003)
  - Changed the LogLog class so that it is now reference counted.
  - Restored the LOG4CPLUS_*_STR logging macros.
  - Added support to disable the ERROR and FATAL macros by defining
    LOG4CPLUS_DISABLE_*
  - API Change:  The LOG4CPLUS_TRACE macro now has behavior similar to all of 
    the other logging macros.  If the old behavior is desired, then the new
    LOG4CPLUS_TRACE_METHOD macro should be used.
  - Modified Appender class to support the "Threshold" property.
  - "localtime" is now the default time in log4cplus.
  - The FileAppender no longer prints out the "header" when it opens a file.
  - Added the "immediateFlush" field to the FileAppender class.
  - Changed the API of the LogLevelManager class.
  - Initial port work done to run on MacOS X.
  - Added the HierarchyLocker class
  - Added the ConfigureAndWatchThread class for runtime dynamic reconfiguration.
  - Added several performance enhancements to the InternalLoggingEvent class.
  - Renamed the PatternLayout "Pattern" configuration option to 
    "ConversionPattern".
  - Added 3 new tests: configandwatch_test, customloglevel_test, and 
    performance_test.  (No MSVC projects created for these tests, yet.)


Version 0.9.7 (June 28 2003)
  - Added the log4cplus::DailyRollingFileAppender class.
  - Added the log4cplus::helper::Time class.  Now log with millisecond 
    granularity. (microsecond granularity if the gettimeofday() function is
    available.)
  - Changed log4cplus::spi::InternalLoggingEvent from a POD to a class and
    introduced several performance ehancements to that class.  This class
    can now be extended to introduce "customized" logging.
  - Fixed Bug #757989 - "TraceLogger should not hold a Logger reference"
  - Added TYPE_SOCKLEN_T to configure.in (checking for whether <sys/socket.h> 
    defines `socklen_t').
  - Added the "operator!=" to log4cplus::helpers::SharedObjectPtr.
  - Made changes to make the DEC CXX 6.1 compiler happy.
  - Renamed the tolower and toupper methods to avoid a name collision with a
    macro with the DEC CXX compiler.
  - Removed "-lstdc++" from the list of libraries in all Makefiles.


Version 0.9.6 (June 10 2003)
  - Fixed multiple compiler warnings for the MSVC++ 7 compiler
  - Modified configure.in so that it can now build on Solaris.
  - Modified the configure script so that it can build a single-threaded
    library (--enable-threads=no)

  - Optimized single-threaded mode.
  - Fixed some problems with the MSVC++ 7 compiler.


Version 0.9.4 (May-5-2003)

  Now builds loggingserver to act as a source of logging messages from a
  SocketAppender.
  Numerous fixes needed for various compilers.
